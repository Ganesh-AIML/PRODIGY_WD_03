This HTML creates a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players click 3x3 boxes to place "X" or "O". The first to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. The game uses alternating colors for "X" and "O". A result section displays the winner or a draw. JavaScript checks for winners and manages the result display.
